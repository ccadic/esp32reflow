# esp32reflow
Small prototype of ESP32 Reflow controller


Today's design: a small ESP32 based reflow controller. PCB made with KICAD. Enclosure made with solidworks. The features: ESP32 LOLIN32 LITE. ILI9341 2.8 display with touch option activated. MAX31865 the temperature probing. 4 buttons (3 on the panel, one on the rotary encoder).  a 110v/220v relay is also there to power the heater plate.  I'm sending the PCB to the factory . Once tested, I'll upload everything on github (opensource)

It is still a proto. I'm waiting for the PCB to arrive
